# Strava Fitness Performance Analytics 🏃‍♂️📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes personal fitness data from Strava to identify performance trends, correlations between metrics (steps vs. calories), and weekly activity patterns. The goal is to derive actionable insights for training optimization using Python.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Correlation Analysis:** Strong positive correlation observed between daily steps and calories burned.
- **Weekly Trends:** Identified peak activity days and rest patterns.
- **Activity Distribution:** Analyzed the distribution of workout intensities across different times of the week.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** Data visualization (Heatmaps, Scatter plots).
- **NumPy:** Numerical operations.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/EDA.py`: The main script containing the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis logic.
- `images/`: Generated visualizations from the analysis.
